*DOMAIN*: JAVA PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH

## DESCRIPTION

Languages and Technologies Used

•	Java
•	Core Java Libraries
•	Java I/O (File Handling)
•	Console-Based Application
•	Exception Handling
•	Eclipse IDE
•	Java Development Kit (JDK)

Platform Used

The platform used to develop and execute this project is the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Eclipse is commonly preferred for academic and internship-related Java projects because it provides a user-friendly workspace that simplifies coding, testing, and debugging. It allows developers to organize Java projects and packages efficiently while offering helpful features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and clear error reporting. These features are especially useful for beginners and interns, as they reduce the learning curve and help in identifying mistakes quickly. The program is executed in a console-based environment, which means it runs through the command prompt or Eclipse console without requiring a graphical user interface. The application is compatible with any operating system that supports Java, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, as long as the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed properly. Since the project does not depend on additional software or third-party libraries, it can be easily run on most systems with a basic Java setup.

Applications

This task is applicable in multiple learning and professional contexts. In academic environments, it is commonly assigned in subjects such as Java Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, and Computer Science laboratory courses to help students understand how data can be stored and managed using files. From an internship perspective, this task demonstrates a fundamental skill that is often expected from entry-level Java developers, as file handling is a basic requirement in many software projects. In real-world applications, similar file handling logic is used in areas such as log file maintenance, storing user input, generating reports, managing configuration files, and handling simple data storage where a database is not required. Completing this task helps learners build confidence in core Java concepts and prepares them for more advanced topics such as database connectivity, backend development, and enterprise-level applications. It also encourages disciplined coding habits, proper resource management, and a clear understanding of how applications interact with the file system, which are valuable skills in professional software development.
